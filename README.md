- **AI Analysis:** Automatically detect parcel size and volume from images.
- **Driver Portal:** Mobile-responsive interface for task execution.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- OpenCV & YOLOv8
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Bootstrap)
- SQLite Database

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install ultralytics flask opencv-python`
2. Run the application: `python app.py`
3. Access via browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
